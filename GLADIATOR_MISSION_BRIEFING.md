**Current State**:
- ✅ Strategic pivot approved (Option A)
- ✅ Red Team foundation: 3,134 high-quality diverse patterns
- ✅ Infrastructure VALIDATED: ALPHA (512GB RAM), BETA (256GB RAM, 16TB SSD)
- ✅ Qwen3-14B VALIDATED: 42.5 tok/s (141% of target)
- ✅ GitHub Actions deployed: ALPHA & BETA runners operational
- ✅ Smoke test PASSED: Both runners verified
- ⏳ Reality Check: READY TO EXECUTE (CRITICAL GO/NO-GO GATE)

**Timeline**: 8 weeks to production (December 11, 2025 target)

**Critical Path**: Reality Check → Pattern Expansion → Blue Team Training → Distillation → Production

## PRIME DIRECTIVE ENFORCEMENT 🔴

**ALL agents must follow these rules**:

### **1. NO FALSE CLAIMS**
- ❌ "Should work" = UNVERIFIED
- ❌ Attempted ≠ Completed  
- ❌ Assume FAILED until proven SUCCESS
- ✅ Report what IS, not what you WANT

### **2. VERIFY EVERYTHING**
- ✅ Task actually completed (not just attempted)
- ✅ Evidence exists (files, measurements, logs)
- ✅ Results meet success criteria
- ✅ Would another agent be deceived?

### **3. EVIDENCE REQUIRED**
Every task completion MUST include:
- File paths (with sizes, checksums)
- Measurements (numbers, not opinions)
- Logs (error-free execution proof)
- Test results (pass/fail with criteria)

### **4. DEFAULT STATE**
```
DEFAULT = FAILED
├─ Task status = 'pending' until proven 'completed'
├─ Verification = 'pending' until evidence provided
└─ Success = FALSE until measurements confirm TRUE
```

---

## TASK TRACKING SYSTEM

### **Database Tables**

**1. `gladiator_execution_plan`** - Master task list
- 17 tasks across 7 weeks
- Each task has: ID, week, day, description, criteria, verification requirements

**2. `gladiator_task_completions`** - Evidence log
- Record of all task completions
- Evidence, verification checklist, prime directive compliance

**3. `gladiator_project_state`** - Overall progress
- Current week, phase, next critical task
- Execution plan version, metadata

### **Task Status Workflow**

```
pending → in_progress → completed
   ↓           ↓            ↓
   └─────> verification ────┘
              ├─ verified (evidence provided)
              └─ failed (insufficient evidence)
```

---

## CURRENT MISSION: WEEK 0 REALITY CHECK

### **Purpose**
Validate fine-tuning approach on 1,000-sample test before committing to full 45K-pattern training (Option A strategy).

### **Success Criteria (MANDATORY)**
- Detection accuracy ≥90% on 100-sample validation
- Training loss decreases steadily
- Model produces coherent predictions
- Zero critical errors

**IF <90% accuracy**: STOP Phase 0, investigate, retest

## TASK COMPLETION PROTOCOL

### **Step 1: Execute Task**
Follow detailed instructions in:
- `GLADIATOR_EXECUTION_PLAN_v2.3.md`
- Location: `/Users/arthurdell/Documents/Dropbox/GLADIATOR/`

### **Step 2: Verify Completion**
Collect evidence:
- File paths with sizes
- Checksums (MD5 or SHA256)
- Measurements (seconds, GB, percentages)
- Test results (pass/fail)
- Error logs (should be empty)

### **Step 3: Update Database**

```sql
-- Mark task complete
UPDATE gladiator_execution_plan 
SET status = 'completed',
    completion_date = NOW(),
    verification_status = 'verified',
    actual_result = '[ACTUAL result with measurements]'
WHERE task_id = [task_id];

-- Log completion with evidence
INSERT INTO gladiator_task_completions (
    task_id,
    completed_by,
    completion_timestamp,
    verification_evidence,
    prime_directive_verified,
    verification_checklist,
    notes
) VALUES (
    [task_id],
    'Arthur',
    NOW(),
    'FILE: /path/to/file.ext (SIZE: 6.2MB, MD5: abc123...)',
    true,
    '{"verified": true, "file_exists": true, "size_correct": true}',
    'Task completed successfully with full verification'
);
```

### **Step 4: Report Completion**
Format:
```
✅ TASK [ID] COMPLETE - [Task Name]

Evidence:
├─ File: /path/to/output.ext
├─ Size: 6.2 MB
├─ Checksum: abc123...
├─ Duration: 2.5 hours
└─ Result: SUCCESS

Verification:
├─ Success criteria met: YES
├─ Prime directive verified: YES
└─ Database updated: YES

Next task: [Next task ID and name]
```

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Reality Check is MANDATORY GO/NO-GO gate**

2. **Prime Directive ALWAYS applies**
   - No false claims
   - Verify everything
   - Evidence required
   - Default = FAILED until proven SUCCESS

3. **Task dependencies are strict**
   - Cannot skip tasks

   - Each task blocks next task

4. **Timeline is aggressive but achievable**
   - 7-8 weeks to production (best case)
   - Contingency: 9-10 weeks
   - Target: December 10, 2025

5. **Database is source of truth**
   - Update after every task
   - Include evidence
   - Verify prime directive compliance
