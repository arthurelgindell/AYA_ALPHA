## Week 0: Reality Check (Foundation)

**Status**: Pending Execution  
**Duration**: 3-4 hours  
**Critical Path**: Dataset generation on BETA

**Tasks**:
1. Generate Reality Check Dataset (BETA, 2-3 hours)
2. Transfer Dataset to ALPHA (30 minutes)
3. Split Dataset 900/100 (ALPHA, 30 minutes)
4. Foundation Model Baseline Test
5. Fine-Tuning Configuration

**Key Milestones**:
- Validated Qwen3-14B performance: 42.5 tok/s (141% of target)
- Infrastructure tested and verified
- Distributed worker system operational
- PostgreSQL HA cluster deployed

**Completion**: Pending (ready to execute)

---

## Agent Turbo Integration

**Version**: 2.0 (PostgreSQL Migration Complete)
- All agent sessions tracked in database
- Task delegation operational
- Complete audit trail
- Performance: 18ms queries, 44ms context generation

**GLADIATOR Coordination**:
- Workers coordinate via agent_tasks table
- Sessions logged in agent_sessions
- Actions tracked in agent_actions
- Full visibility across both systems

## Next Actions

**Immediate**: Execute Reality Check (Week 0)
1. Trigger GitHub Actions workflow
2. Monitor execution on BETA
3. Verify dataset generation
4. Transfer to ALPHA
5. Split and prepare for fine-tuning

**Timeline**: 3-4 hours to complete Week 0
