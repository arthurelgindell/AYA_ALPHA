# JITM Location Reconciliation

**Date**: October 26, 2025  
**Issue**: Two JITM locations discovered  
**Resolution**: Determine authoritative location

---

## SITUATION

### Two JITM Folders Found

**Location 1**: `/Users/arthurdell/JITM/` (ALPHA's version)
- Source: ALPHA state report
- Files: 24 (17 code files)
- Type: Docker-based FastAPI application
- Status: Production architecture
- Syncthing: Configured for sync
- Database: 10 tables deployed in aya_rag

**Location 2**: `/Volumes/DATA/JITM/` (BETA's version)
- Source: BETA exploration (this session)
- Files: ~60+ (many docs created by BETA)
- Type: n8n workflow focused
- Status: Design documentation
- Syncthing: No .stfolder marker
- Database: Schema files ready (not deployed)

---

## ANALYSIS

### Why Two Locations?

**Timeline**:
1. **Oct 25**: BETA found/created `/Volumes/DATA/JITM/` with initial structure
2. **Oct 26 (today)**: BETA (this session) created extensive documentation there
3. **Oct 26 (today)**: ALPHA developed actual JITM at `/Users/arthurdell/JITM/`
4. **Oct 26 15:20**: ALPHA reports completed work at home directory location

**Conclusion**: Parallel development on different architectures

### Which is Authoritative?

**ALPHA's Version** (`/Users/arthurdell/JITM/`):
- ✅ Database schema DEPLOYED (10 tables live)
- ✅ Docker architecture implemented
- ✅ Integrated with Agent Turbo v2.0
- ✅ Active-Active HA design
- ✅ FastAPI + Celery implementation
- ✅ 24 optimized files
- ✅ deploy-beta.sh ready
- ✅ Committed to Git (8 commits)

**BETA's Version** (`/Volumes/DATA/JITM/`):
- ⚠️ Documentation and design work
- ⚠️ Schema defined but not deployed
- ⚠️ Different architecture (n8n workflow focused)
- ⚠️ Many temporary files
- ❌ Not in Git
- ❌ Database not deployed

**Decision**: **ALPHA's version is authoritative** - it's deployed and operational

---

## RECONCILIATION STRATEGY

### Option A: Archive BETA's Work, Use ALPHA's Version

**Steps**:
1. Archive BETA's work
   ```bash
   mv /Volumes/DATA/JITM /Volumes/DATA/JITM_beta_design_work_archive
   ```

2. Wait for Syncthing to sync ALPHA's version
   ```bash
   # ALPHA's JITM will sync to /Users/arthurdell/JITM on BETA
   ls -la /Users/arthurdell/JITM/
   ```

3. Use ALPHA's deploy-beta.sh
   ```bash
   cd /Users/arthurdell/JITM
   ./deploy-beta.sh
   ```

**Pros**: Clean, uses production-ready code, no conflicts  
**Cons**: Loses BETA's documentation work

### Option B: Merge Useful BETA Work into ALPHA's Version

**Steps**:
1. Pull ALPHA's latest
   ```bash
   cd /Volumes/DATA/AYA
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Wait for ALPHA's JITM sync
   ```bash
   # Wait for /Users/arthurdell/JITM to appear
   ```

3. Copy useful BETA docs to ALPHA's location
   ```bash
   cp /Volumes/DATA/JITM/JITM_HA_CLUSTER_EVALUATION.md /Users/arthurdell/JITM/docs/
   cp /Volumes/DATA/JITM/migrations/002_jitm_project_state.sql /Users/arthurdell/JITM/migrations/
   # (if ALPHA's version doesn't have project state table)
   ```

4. Archive BETA's folder
   ```bash
   mv /Volumes/DATA/JITM /Volumes/DATA/JITM_beta_archive
   ```

**Pros**: Preserves useful work, merges best of both  
**Cons**: More complex, requires manual selection

### Option C: Keep Both (Not Recommended)

Keep both locations for different purposes.

**Pros**: None  
**Cons**: Confusion, conflicts, unclear which to use

---

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**Use Option A** (Archive BETA's work, use ALPHA's version):

### Reasoning

1. ALPHA's version is **deployed and operational** (database live)
2. ALPHA's version follows **production HA patterns** (Active-Active)
3. ALPHA's architecture is **more advanced** (FastAPI + Celery vs n8n only)
4. ALPHA's version is **in Git** (8 commits, clean history)
5. BETA's work was **exploratory** (good analysis, but superseded by implementation)

### What to Preserve from BETA's Work

Useful BETA creations:
- ✅ HA Cluster evaluation (good analysis)
- ✅ Project state table concept (may still be needed)
- ✅ Git initialization approach (if JITM needs own repo)

Everything else ALPHA has better versions of.

## EXECUTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Sync with ALPHA (30 minutes)

```bash
# Pull Git changes
cd /Volumes/DATA/AYA
git pull origin main

# Wait for Syncthing
sleep 600  # 10 minutes

# Verify JITM synced
ls -la /Users/arthurdell/JITM/
```

### Phase 2: Archive BETA's Work (5 minutes)

```bash
# Create archive
mkdir -p /Volumes/DATA/archives
mv /Volumes/DATA/JITM /Volumes/DATA/archives/JITM_beta_design_work_2025-10-26

# Document what was archived
cat > /Volumes/DATA/archives/JITM_README.txt << 'EOF'
This folder contains BETA's exploratory work on JITM from October 26, 2025.

It was created before ALPHA's production Docker architecture was synced.
ALPHA's version at /Users/arthurdell/JITM is the authoritative implementation.

This archive contains:
- HA cluster evaluation
- Database schema designs
- Git initialization work
- Various deployment scripts

Useful elements were merged into ALPHA's version.
EOF
```

### Phase 3: Deploy JITM (20 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/arthurdell/JITM

# Create BETA environment
cat > .env.beta << 'EOF'
SYSTEM_NAME=beta
SYSTEM_ID=2
JITM_API_PORT=8100
POSTGRES_HOST=alpha.tail5f2bae.ts.net
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=Power$$336633$$
AGENT_TURBO_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8765
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=http://beta.tail5f2bae.ts.net:8080/webhook
LOG_LEVEL=info
EOF

# Deploy
./deploy-beta.sh

# Verify
docker ps | grep jitm
curl http://localhost:8100/health
```

## FILES CREATED FOR RESOLUTION

1. **`ALPHA_STATE_REPORT_2025-10-26.md`** - Full ALPHA state captured
2. **`CRITICAL_JITM_LOCATION_UPDATE.md`** - Location mismatch alert
3. **`RECONCILE_JITM_LOCATIONS.md`** - This reconciliation plan
4. **`BETA_SYNC_ACTION_REQUIRED.txt`** - Quick action guide

---

## SUMMARY

**Problem**: Two JITM locations with different architectures  
**Root Cause**: Parallel development without coordination  
**Resolution**: Use ALPHA's version (deployed, operational, in Git)  
**Action**: Pull Git, wait for Syncthing, archive BETA's work, deploy JITM  
**Time**: ~1 hour total

**ALPHA's JITM is production-ready and follows the same HA cluster patterns as PostgreSQL and n8n.**
