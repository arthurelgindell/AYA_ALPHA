### TASK 23: Blue Team Training Scripts

**Timeline**: 3 hours

**Objective**: Create production-ready training and validation scripts

**Scripts to Create**:
1. `prepare_blue_team_dataset.py` - Dataset preparation
2. `launch_blue_team_training.sh` - Training launcher
3. `validate_blue_team_model.py` - Validation script
4. `quality_check.py` - Sample quality validation

**Configuration**:
- Model: Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct-int8
- Method: LoRA (rank 16, alpha 32)
- Iterations: 500
- Batch size: 4
- Learning rate: 1e-4
- Validation: Every 50 iterations

---

### TASK 24: Quality Validation Framework

**Timeline**: 2 hours

**Objective**: Create framework to validate sample quality before training

**Quality Checks**:
1. **Format Validation**
   - JSON structure correct
   - Required fields present (id, template, attack_code, attack_type)
   - Chat format valid

2. **Content Validation**
   - Attack code non-empty
   - Attack type in approved list
   - No duplicate IDs
   - Response length reasonable (50-2000 chars)

3. **Distribution Validation**
   - Balanced categories (Â±10% variance)
   - Attack vs benign ratio: 50/50
   - No category dominance (max 15% per category)

4. **Technical Validation**
   - Code syntax parseable
   - Attack patterns realistic
   - No prompt injection in samples

**Deliverable**: `quality_validation_report.json` with pass/fail status

---

### TASK 25: Week 1 Progress Documentation

**Timeline**: 1 hour

**Objective**: Document Week 1 complete status for project tracking

**Documents to Create**:
1. `WEEK_1_COMPLETE_REPORT.md` - Full week summary
2. Update `GLADIATOR_EXECUTION_STATUS_REPORT.txt`
3. Update database with Week 1 completion
4. GitHub sync with all documentation

### Dataset Generation âœ“
- [ ] Process running continuously
- [ ] 200-300 samples generated (25-37% of 800)
- [ ] No errors in log
- [ ] Average generation rate: 1-2 samples/min

### Documentation âœ“
- [ ] Week 2-3 plan complete and reviewed
- [ ] Training scripts created and validated
- [ ] Quality framework operational
- [ ] Week 1 documentation finalized

### Infrastructure âœ“
- [ ] Monitor script working
- [ ] Storage adequate (>13 TB)

- [ ] All tools ready for Week 2-3

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Low Risk**:
- Dataset generation (process running, BETA stable)
- Documentation (straightforward, no dependencies)
- Infrastructure (all verified working)

**Medium Risk**:
- Generation speed (may be slower than estimated)
- Sample quality (unknown until review at 80+ samples)

**Mitigation**:
- Monitor every 2-4 hours
- Quality check first 100 samples
- Adjust timeline if generation slower than expected

---

## NEXT MILESTONE

**Task 19**: Quality review (when 80+ samples ready)
- Expected: Oct 23 afternoon or evening
- Action: Run quality validation on first batch
- Decision: Continue or adjust generation parameters

**Task 21**: Week 1 completion review (Day 7, Oct 29)
- Full week summary
- Week 2-3 GO/NO-GO decision
- Timeline adjustment if needed

---

**DAY 2 STATUS**: READY TO EXECUTE

Monitor dataset generation while preparing Week 2-3 infrastructure.
