## RISK ASSESSMENT

### High Priority Risks

**Risk 1: Dataset Quality Issues**
- Probability: Medium
- Impact: High (training fails or poor accuracy)
- Mitigation: Rigorous quality validation before training
- Contingency: Regenerate or augment low-quality categories

**Risk 2: Training Convergence Failure**
- Probability: Low
- Impact: High (model doesn't learn)
- Mitigation: Monitor loss continuously, stop if not decreasing
- Contingency: Adjust learning rate, extend iterations, check data

**Risk 3: Privilege Escalation Accuracy Still Low**
- Probability: Medium
- Impact: Medium (one category fails)
- Mitigation: 800 samples focused on this category
- Contingency: Additional focused generation + re-training

### Medium Priority Risks

**Risk 4: Training Time Longer Than Expected**
- Probability: Medium
- Impact: Low (delays by 1-2 days)
- Mitigation: Built-in buffer (10 days for 4-8 hour training)
- Contingency: Continue training, adjust timeline

**Risk 5: Storage Constraints**
- Probability: Low
- Impact: Low (14 TB available, need ~100 GB)
- Mitigation: Monitor storage continuously
- Contingency: Clean up old checkpoints if needed
