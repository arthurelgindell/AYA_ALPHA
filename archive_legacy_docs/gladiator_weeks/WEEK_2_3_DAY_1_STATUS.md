## DATASET STRATEGY - WORLD-CLASS APPROACH

**Decision**: Option B - Comprehensive (Binary + Multi-Class)

**Why Include Benign Samples**:
1. **Reduce False Positives**: Model learns normal vs attack patterns
2. **Binary Classification**: First gate (attack/benign) before type detection
3. **Production Reliability**: Prevents overwhelming security team with false alarms
4. **World-Class Standard**: Dual capability for robust deployment

**Architecture**:
```
Input → Binary Classification (attack/benign)
         ├─ If benign → Flag as safe
         └─ If attack → Multi-Class Detection (SQL/XSS/phishing/etc.)
```

- Attack generation time: May take 4-6 hours (monitoring actively)
- Sample quality: Will validate before training

**Mitigation**:
- Monitor every 2 hours
- Quality check at 200 samples
- Can start training with subset if needed
