# Embedding Service - LM Studio Model Loading Issue

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Issue**: LM Studio embedding model needs to be loaded manually  
**Status**: ⚠️ **REQUIRES USER ACTION**

---

## Issue Identified

The embedding service is configured correctly, but LM Studio requires the embedding model to be **manually loaded** in the LM Studio UI before it can be used via the API.

### Error Message

```
Failed to load model "text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5". 
Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'backendInfo')
```

---

## Solution

### Step 1: Load Embedding Model in LM Studio

1. **Open LM Studio** on ALPHA
2. **Go to "Chat" or "Local Server" tab**
3. **Select Model**: `text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5`
4. **Click "Load"** to load the model into memory
5. **Verify**: Model should show as "Loaded" in LM Studio

### Step 2: Verify Model is Loaded

```bash
# Check if model responds
curl -X POST http://localhost:1234/v1/embeddings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5","input":"test"}'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "object": "embedding",
      "embedding": [0.123, -0.456, ...],  // 768 dimensions
      "index": 0
    }
  ],
  "model": "text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5"
}
```

### Step 3: Test Embedding Service

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/embed \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "test"}'
```

## Alternative: Use Different Model

If `text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5` has issues, try `nomicai-modernbert-embed-base`:

```bash
# Update service to use alternative model
# Edit: /Users/arthurdell/AYA/services/embedding_service.py
# Change: EMBEDDING_MODEL = "nomicai-modernbert-embed-base"
```

**Note**: Different models may have different embedding dimensions. Update `EMBEDDING_DIM` accordingly.

---

## Service Status

- ✅ **Service Code**: Correctly configured
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: Working
- ✅ **LM Studio Connection**: Verified
- ⚠️ **Model Loading**: Requires manual load in LM Studio UI

---

## Recommendation

**Best Practice**: Load the embedding model in LM Studio and keep it loaded. The model will remain in memory until LM Studio is restarted or the model is unloaded.

**Auto-Load**: Consider configuring LM Studio to auto-load the embedding model on startup, or add a startup script that loads it via LM Studio's API (if available).

---

**Action Required**: Load `text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5` in LM Studio UI, then the embedding service will work correctly.
