# Alpha and Beta Cluster Disconnection

**Date**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **SYSTEMS DISCONNECTED**

---

## Summary

Alpha and Beta have been successfully disconnected from the Patroni HA cluster. Both systems are now **discrete, independent PostgreSQL instances** with no replication or clustering connections.

---

## Actions Taken

### 1. Patroni Cluster Stopped

**ALPHA**:
- ✅ Patroni processes terminated
- ✅ Launchd services unloaded

**BETA**:
- ✅ Patroni processes terminated
- ✅ Launchd services unloaded

### 2. etcd Consensus Cluster Stopped

**ALPHA**:
- ✅ etcd processes terminated
- ✅ No consensus coordination active

**BETA**:
- ✅ etcd processes terminated
- ✅ No consensus coordination active

### 3. Database Replication Disabled

**Configuration Changes**:
- ✅ Synchronous replication disabled
- ✅ Replication slots: Will be removed on restart
- ✅ Max WAL senders: Set to 0
- ✅ Max replication slots: Set to 0

**Active Connections**:
- ✅ No active replication connections
- ✅ No cluster communication

---

## Current Status

### ALPHA
- **Database**: Independent PostgreSQL instance
- **Location**: `/Library/PostgreSQL/18/data` (on ALPHA)
- **Status**: Shut down
- **Cluster**: Disconnected

### BETA
- **Database**: Independent PostgreSQL instance
- **Location**: `/Users/arthurdell/AYA/database/postgresql18/data` (on BETA)
- **Status**: Can be started independently
- **Cluster**: Disconnected

---

## Services Stopped

| Service | ALPHA | BETA |
|---------|-------|------|
| Patroni | ✅ Stopped | ✅ Stopped |
| etcd | ✅ Stopped | ✅ Stopped |
| Launchd Services | ✅ Unloaded | ✅ Unloaded |
| Replication | ✅ Disabled | ✅ Disabled |

---

## Next Steps

### To Start PostgreSQL Independently

**ALPHA**:
```bash
/Library/PostgreSQL/18/bin/pg_ctl -D /Library/PostgreSQL/18/data start
```

**BETA**:
```bash
/Library/PostgreSQL/18/bin/pg_ctl -D /Users/arthurdell/AYA/database/postgresql18/data start
```

### To Restore Cluster (Future)

If clustering is needed again:
1. Start etcd on both systems
2. Configure Patroni configs
3. Enable replication in PostgreSQL
4. Start Patroni services

---

## Verification

```bash
# Check ALPHA
ps aux | grep -E "patroni|etcd" | grep -v grep
# Should return: 0 processes

# Check BETA
ssh beta "ps aux | grep -E 'patroni|etcd' | grep -v grep"
# Should return: 0 processes
```

---

## ✅ Status

**Alpha and Beta are now discrete, independent systems.**

No cluster connections, replication, or shared state exists between them.
