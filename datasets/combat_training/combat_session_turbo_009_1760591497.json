Based on this, we can identify potential attack vectors and techniques:\n\n- **Initial Access**: Exploit the RCE vulnerability in Apache Struts.\n- **Execution**: Execute malicious code on the affected system.\n- **Persistence**: Gain persistence by installing backdoors or other means.\n- **Evasion**: Use obfuscation and polymorphism to avoid detection.\n\nReferencing the MITRE ATT&CK framework, we can map these stages to specific techniques",
