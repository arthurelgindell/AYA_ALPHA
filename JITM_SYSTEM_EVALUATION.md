## Integration Points

### 1. Agent Turbo Integration
**Status**: ✅ **READY**

- `jitm_manufacturers.embedding` (vector(768))
- Matches Agent Turbo embedding dimensions
- Can use existing embedding service (http://localhost:8765)
- ivfflat index configured for similarity search

**Use Case**: AI-powered manufacturer matching
```python
from agent_turbo import AgentTurbo
at = AgentTurbo()

# Generate embedding for requirement
requirement = "PCB manufacturer with ISO9001, 10k MOQ, 30-day lead time"
embedding = at.generate_embedding(requirement)

# Search manufacturers via pgvector
db.execute_query("""
    SELECT company_name, capabilities, rating, lead_time_days
    FROM jitm_manufacturers
    WHERE embedding <=> %s < 0.3
    ORDER BY embedding <=> %s
    LIMIT 10
""", (embedding, embedding))
```

### 2. n8n Workflow Integration
**Status**: ✅ **READY**

- `jitm_workflow_state` designed for automation
- n8n deployed in Active-Active HA (change_log ID 9)
- Can trigger workflows per JITM stage:
  - RFQ generation → email to manufacturers
  - Quote received → evaluation workflow
  - Contract signed → order placement
  - Order shipped → logistics tracking
  - Delivery confirmed → payment processing

**n8n Endpoints**:
- ALPHA: http://alpha.tail5f2bae.ts.net:8080
- BETA: http://beta.tail5f2bae.ts.net:8080

### 3. PostgreSQL HA Cluster
**Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL**

- Synchronous replication (0-byte lag)
- Automatic failover < 30 seconds
- Both ALPHA and BETA can access JITM tables
- Single endpoint: alpha.tail5f2bae.ts.net:5432

## Performance Characteristics

### Current Performance

**Storage**: 1.52 MB (empty tables with indexes)
**Indexes**: 36 total (optimized for operational queries)
**Estimated Performance** (with 10,000 manufacturers):
- Manufacturer search via pgvector: <50ms
- Status queries: <10ms (indexed)
- Join queries (project→products→rfqs): <20ms
- Full workflow trace: <100ms

### Scalability Assessment

**Projected Load** (per year):
- Projects: 100-500
- Campaigns: 200-1,000
- Products: 1,000-5,000
- Manufacturers: 10,000-50,000 (with embeddings: 384-1,920 MB)
- RFQs: 5,000-20,000
- Quotes: 10,000-50,000
- Contracts: 2,000-10,000
- Orders: 2,000-10,000
- Logistics: 2,000-10,000
- Workflow instances: 500-2,000

**Estimated Database Size**: 5-20 GB (including indexes and embeddings)

**Verdict**: ✅ Current schema scales to enterprise volume

---

## Security & Data Integrity

### Foreign Key Coverage
✅ **100% coverage** - All relationships enforced

### Cascade Deletes
✅ **Properly configured**:
- Delete project → cascades to campaigns, products, workflow_state
- Delete manufacturer → cascades to rfqs, quotes, contracts, orders
- Prevents orphaned data

### Unique Constraints
✅ **Business keys protected**:
- rfq_number (unique)
- order_number (unique)
- contract_number (unique)

### JSONB Validation
⚠️ **No constraints** - JSONB fields accept any valid JSON
**Recommendation**: Add check constraints for critical JSONB fields

---

## Gaps & Recommendations

### Critical Gaps: NONE
All core functionality is present.

### Enhancement Opportunities:

1. **Add JSONB Schema Validation**
```sql
ALTER TABLE jitm_manufacturers 
ADD CONSTRAINT valid_capabilities 
CHECK (jsonb_typeof(capabilities) = 'object');
```

2. **Add Business Logic Constraints**
```sql
ALTER TABLE jitm_products
ADD CONSTRAINT quantity_positive 
CHECK (quantity > 0);

ALTER TABLE jitm_quotes
ADD CONSTRAINT unit_price_positive 
CHECK (unit_price > 0);
```

3. **Add Status Enums**
```sql
CREATE TYPE jitm_project_status AS ENUM ('draft', 'active', 'completed', 'cancelled');
ALTER TABLE jitm_projects 
ALTER COLUMN status TYPE jitm_project_status USING status::jitm_project_status;
```

4. **Add Audit Triggers**
```sql
CREATE TABLE jitm_audit_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name VARCHAR(100),
    record_id UUID,
    action VARCHAR(20),
    old_data JSONB,
    new_data JSONB,
    changed_by VARCHAR(100),
    changed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

5. **Documentation**
```sql
COMMENT ON TABLE jitm_manufacturers IS 'Manufacturer database with AI-powered matching via pgvector embeddings';
COMMENT ON COLUMN jitm_manufacturers.embedding IS 'Vector embedding (768 dimensions) for similarity search';
```

db = PostgreSQLConnector()

# Create test project
project_id = db.execute_query("""
    INSERT INTO jitm_projects 
    (name, description, project_type, status, priority, budget_min, budget_max)
    VALUES 
    ('Test Campaign', 'Testing JITM system', 'campaign', 'draft', 8, 10000, 50000)
    RETURNING id
""", fetch=True)[0]['id']

print(f"✅ JITM activated! First project: {project_id}")
