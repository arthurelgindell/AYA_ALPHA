# AYA Bulletproof Relay Cycles - Evaluation Guide

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**System:** ALPHA↔BETA Recursive Self-Improvement Protocol  
**Purpose:** Clear presentation of relay cycle flow and evaluation criteria

---

## 1. RELAY CYCLE OVERVIEW

### Core Concept
ALPHA and BETA alternate between SOURCE and TARGET roles, with each cycle improving the AYA system. The SOURCE analyzes and enhances the TARGET, then roles swap for continuous evolution.

## 5. PRACTICAL EXAMPLE

### Scenario: Improving Agent Turbo Performance

**Cycle Setup:**
- SOURCE: ALPHA
- TARGET: BETA
- Goal: Improve Agent Turbo query performance by 25%

**Phase Progression:**

1. **INIT** (2 seconds)
   - Cycle ID: `a7b8c9d0-1234-5678-90ab-cdef12345678`
   - ALPHA = SOURCE, BETA = TARGET

2. **ANALYZE** (2 hours)
   - Current query time: 450ms average
   - Bottleneck: Inefficient embedding searches
   - Opportunity: Optimize pgvector indexes

3. **ENHANCE** (4 hours)
   - Design: New HNSW indexes for embeddings
   - Plan: Parallel query execution
   - Expected: 35% performance gain

4. **MILESTONE GATE #1** (15 minutes)
   - Risk: Medium (index rebuild required)
   - Impact: 2-hour maintenance window
   - Decision: APPROVED with scheduled window

5. **TRANSFER** (2 hours)
   - Deploy new indexes to BETA
   - Update query planner settings
   - Migrate active connections

6. **VALIDATE** (6 hours)
   - Actual query time: 285ms average
   - Performance gain: 37% (exceeds target)
   - System stable, no errors

7. **MILESTONE GATE #2** (10 minutes)
   - Results exceed expectations
   - No regression detected
   - Decision: APPROVED for completion

8. **COMPLETE** (1 minute)
   - Cycle marked successful
   - Metrics recorded
   - Ready for role swap

**Next Cycle:** BETA becomes SOURCE, ALPHA becomes TARGET

## 6. ROLE SWAP MECHANICS

### How Swapping Works

After COMPLETE phase:
```
Cycle N:   ALPHA (SOURCE) → BETA (TARGET)
           ALPHA analyzes and improves BETA

Cycle N+1: BETA (SOURCE) → ALPHA (TARGET)  
           BETA analyzes and improves ALPHA

Cycle N+2: ALPHA (SOURCE) → BETA (TARGET)
           And so on...
```

### Benefits of Role Swapping

1. **Balanced Evolution:** Both nodes improve continuously
2. **Cross-Pollination:** Innovations spread bidirectionally  
3. **Redundancy:** Each node can enhance the other
4. **Perspective:** Different analysis from each side
5. **Resilience:** No single point of failure

---

## 7. GOVERNANCE MODEL

### Semi-Autonomous Operation

**Autonomous Phases:**
- INIT → ANALYZE → ENHANCE (fully automated)
- TRANSFER → VALIDATE (automated after approval)
- Verification checkpoints (automated testing)

**Human Control Points:**
- Milestone Gate #1: Approve deployment
- Milestone Gate #2: Approve completion
- Emergency stop: Can halt any phase
- Override: Can skip gates (logged)

### Prime Directives Enforcement

**Directive 1: Functional Reality**
- All operations are real (no mocks)
- Database transactions committed
- Actual system changes made

**Directive 2: Truth Over Comfort**  
- Failures are logged and visible
- Metrics cannot be faked
- Regression triggers alerts

**Directive 3: Execute with Precision**
- Phase order enforced by database
- Verification mandatory
- Audit trail immutable

```python
cycle_id = await initiate_relay_cycle(
    source_node="ALPHA",
    target_node="BETA", 
    enhancement_goals={
        "target": "specific_component",
        "metric": "improvement_goal",
        "priority": "high"
    }
)
```

### Progress Through Phases:
```python
# Automatic phases
await transition_relay_phase(cycle_id, "ANALYZE", evidence)
await transition_relay_phase(cycle_id, "ENHANCE", evidence)

# Request approval
approval_id = await request_milestone_approval(
    cycle_id, "TRANSFER_APPROVAL", description, impact
)

# Grant approval
await grant_milestone_approval(approval_id, "Arthur", notes)

# Continue after approval
await transition_relay_phase(cycle_id, "TRANSFER", evidence)
```

### Monitor Progress:
```python
status = await get_relay_status(cycle_id)
approvals = await get_pending_approvals()
```

## SUMMARY

The relay cycle system provides:
1. **Structured improvement process** with clear phases
2. **Human oversight** at critical points
3. **Automated verification** of system health
4. **Immutable audit trail** for compliance
5. **Continuous evolution** through role swapping

Each cycle must meet strict criteria:
- Complete all 6 phases in order
- Pass all 6 verification checkpoints  
- Obtain 2 milestone approvals
- Achieve measurable improvements
- Maintain system stability

The system enforces Prime Directives through database constraints, ensuring functional reality, truth over comfort, and precise execution.
