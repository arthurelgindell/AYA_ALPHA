AYA BULLETPROOF ARCHITECTURE (v5.0)
=============================================================================

OVERVIEW:
The AYA Bulletproof Architecture provides immutable audit trails, milestone-gated
relay cycles, and Prime Directives enforcement for ALPHA↔BETA coordination.

KEY COMPONENTS:

1. IMMUTABLE AUDIT TRAIL (aya_bulletproof_audit)
   - Blockchain-style append-only event log
   - NO DELETE/UPDATE rules enforced
   - Cryptographic hash chaining
   - Complete forensic evidence preservation

2. RELAY CYCLE ORCHESTRATION (aya_relay_cycles)
   - ALPHA↔BETA recursive self-improvement
   - 6 phases: INIT → ANALYZE → ENHANCE → TRANSFER* → VALIDATE → COMPLETE*
   - Milestone gates at TRANSFER and COMPLETE phases
   - Role swapping for continuous improvement

3. BULLETPROOF VERIFICATION (aya_verification_chain)
   - 4-Phase Prime Directives enforcement:
     • Phase 1: Component Health Verified
     • Phase 2: Dependency Chain + Integration Functional
     • Phase 3: Orchestration Operational
     • Phase 4: User Workflow + Failure Impact
   - Database triggers enforce completion

4. MILESTONE APPROVALS (aya_milestone_approvals)
   - Semi-autonomous operation with manual gates
   - Required for critical phase transitions
   - Full approval tracking and audit trail

5. CROSS-SYSTEM INTEGRATION (aya_system_operations)
   - Links to Agent Turbo orchestration
   - GLADIATOR red team coordination
   - N8N workflow automation tracking
   - Code Audit system verification

KEY FUNCTIONS:
- initiate_relay_cycle(): Start new ALPHA↔BETA cycle
- transition_relay_phase(): Move through phases with gates
- request_milestone_approval(): Request manual approval
- grant_milestone_approval(): Approve transitions
- record_verification_checkpoint(): Record verifications
- relay_cycle_fully_verified(): Check completion

MCP TOOLS AVAILABLE:
The aya-bulletproof MCP server provides Claude Desktop integration:
- Start and manage relay cycles
- Request and grant approvals
- Record verification checkpoints
- Monitor system health
- Track enhancements

MONITORING VIEWS:
- aya_platform_status: Live system status across all subsystems
- aya_pending_approvals: Dashboard for approval queue
- aya_relay_performance: Historical metrics and improvements
- aya_active_relay_details: Current cycle information

LISTEN/NOTIFY CHANNELS:
- aya_relay_phase: Phase transition events
- aya_verification: Checkpoint notifications
- aya_milestone_approval: Approval requests
- aya_audit_event: Critical system events

PRIME DIRECTIVES ENFORCEMENT:
1. Functional Reality: Real operations only, no mocks
2. Truth Over Comfort: Failures logged, gates enforced
3. Execute with Precision: Database constraints ensure compliance

FUTURE: GAMMA INTEGRATION
When NVIDIA DGX Spark arrives:
- aya_gamma_workloads table ready
- Subordination control: GAMMA cannot self-authorize
- ALPHA/BETA must approve all compute tasks
- Full resource tracking and audit
